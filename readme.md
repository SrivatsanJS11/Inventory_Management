# Inventory Management Optimization
This project tackles supply-demand imbalances in the instant noodles market using real FMCG data. 
It predicts the optimal number of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) for different warehouse types using machine learning models, 
helping streamline inventory distribution and minimize stockouts or overstocking.

# Project Objective
To build a data-driven inventory optimization model that:
- Analyzes historical sales and inventory data.
- Predicts optimal SKU quantities for various warehouse types.
- Enhances supply chain efficiency in the FMCG sector.

# Tools & Technologies
- Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN  
- Validation: Cross-validation, GridSearchCV  
- Performance Metric: R² score (Best: 0.981 with XGBoost)

# Results
Best-performing model: XGBoost (R² = 0.981)
Enhanced inventory distribution and reduced overstock/stockouts.
